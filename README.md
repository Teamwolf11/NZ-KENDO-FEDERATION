NZKF-301Project
===============

The requirements that we followed were:

New Zealand Kendo Federation (NZKF) would like a member management system where people can go to a website whether on a computer or a phone to sign up, then add and update their personal details, such as name, contact details, sex, ethnicity, what martial art(s) they practice and their home club(s). They will be able to see if their NZKF membership is current, be alerted if their membership expires, and pay for their annual federation membership. They will also be able to register for grading events. The system will be able to check if a member is eligible to grade and send an email alert when a time in grade requirement has been fulfilled. 

The system will allow club leaders to create grading events that members can register for. The grading event booking will record details such as date, hosting club, venue, highest grade available, the names of the grading panel and the head of the grading panel. The system will record the details of clubs, including name, club leader(s), main contact details for the club. 

The historic grading result record will consist of name of the person, the grade, the date of the grading event and the name of the head of the grading panel, and the martial art.
